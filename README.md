# Word Count

You have been supplied with a folder containing various written works formatted as plaintext files in `./sample_data`.
Your must write a program that will read the contents of these files and count the number of times each word occurs in
the text.  The top 10 results should be printed out with each word (followed by its total number of occurrences) on its own line.

To run application clone repo and run following command in the terminal node wordcount.js and you should see the results

The output for the above paragraph would look as follows:
files		2
number  	2
each		2
word		2
supplied	2
folder	    1
containing	1
various	    1
written 	1
works		1

Your program must be easily invoked from the command line, for example `python count_words.py`.  You may design the application
however you like as long as it produces the desired output like that found above.


To run program open your terminal execute this command node wordcount.js

To see different results change the file path 
example of file path to point too
let file = './sample_data/Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad.txt';

Happy coding :)
